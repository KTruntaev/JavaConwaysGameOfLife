# JavaConwaysGameOfLife
A WIP Java implementation of Conway's Game of Life, with a GUI built using JavaFX and SceneBuilder.

The Conway's Game of Life implementation was expanded with RGB "DNA" which allows for more visually interesting simulations. When 3 cells "reproduce" and create a new cell, the resulting cell averages their RGB value.



### GUI Demonstration: 
The GUI is Work-In-Progress, with many features planned, as can be seen by the below TODO list on the bottom of the README:

### TODO
1) [ ] Upgrade the CSS styling
2) [ ] Implement drawing mode
3) [ ] Implement section selection by mouse dragging on the canvas and allowing it to zoom into the selected area
4) [ ] Implement the sparse matrix dictionary for improved performance
